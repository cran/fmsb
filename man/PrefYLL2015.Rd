\title{Years of Life Lost by several causes in Japan 2015 for each prefecture}
\description{
 The data gives years of life lost by several causes in Japan 2015 for each prefecture.
 There are several definitions of YLL.  For example, WHO's Global Burden of Disease
 defines the YLL as  the number of deaths multiplied by the standard life expectancy 
 at the age at which death occurs, for a given cause, age and sex (WHO).
 However, Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare gives the expected increase 
 of the life expectancy at birth if the mortality due to each cause of death is 
 removed from the age-specific mortality as the measure of YLL, and thus this
 dataset implements such data derived from the report of regional life tables
 in Japan (Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, 2015).
